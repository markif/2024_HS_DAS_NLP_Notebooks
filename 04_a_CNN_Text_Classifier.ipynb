It utilize pretrained word embeddings in order to take advantage of [transfer learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning) in NLP. Additionally, it sets the stage for hyperparameter tuning and model design optimization.\n",

    "In order to use pre-trained embeddings in your model, you have to create a mapping from the word indices (provided by the TextVectorizer layer) to the word embedding vectors of the pre-trained embeddings. The embedding layer will use this index to look up the embedding, then pass the embeddings of each word in the input sequence to the next layer. \n",

    "Next, we will create and initialize the weights matrix for the embedding layer. The index position of each word in the vocabulary list (returned by TextVectorizer.get_vocabulary()) is the index that the TextVectorizer will return for each word. Thus we have to set the embedding vector for a word at this index.  We do this by looping over the words in the TextVectorizer vocabulary and the embedding dictionary. Each word encoding from the TextVectorizer will be the row index in the weights matrix and the vector accessed for that word will be the one from the embedding dictionary."
